# Grid Search Algorithms Visualization

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that visualizes six uninformed search algorithms on a grid using Pygame:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)  
3. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)  
4. Depth-Limited Search (DLS)  
5. Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)  
6. Bidirectional Search  

Each algorithm shows the search **step by step** with colored nodes:  
- **Green**: Start node  
- **Blue**: Target node  
- **Red**: Walls/obstacles  
- **Orange**: Frontier nodes  
- **Gray**: Explored nodes  
- **Yellow**: Final path  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Pygame library  

Install Pygame with:
pip install pygame


## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`23F-0574_23F-0535_A1.ipynb`).  
2. Run **each code cell** containing the algorithm you want to test.  
3. A Pygame window will open showing the search visualization for that algorithm.  
4. Close the window to continue or run the next cell.  

Repeat for any other algorithm cells in the notebook.
